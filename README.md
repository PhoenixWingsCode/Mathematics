📘 Math for AI/ML – Algebra, Precalculus & Calculus with Python
This repository is my personal mathematics coding lab — where pure math meets Python, and abstract ideas get turned into tangible, visual, and coded results.

I’ve built this as part of my MCA (AI/ML specialization) journey, ensuring that every concept I study is coded, visualized, and tested. From algebraic basics to calculus applications, each notebook is proof of how I bridge mathematical theory ↔ computational execution.

Why I Built This
For me, math isn’t just a subject — it’s the foundation of AI/ML. This repo is the record of my progression, combining:

Mathematical depth

Algorithmic thinking

Code-based problem solving

Every file here is a deliberate, structured step toward becoming a professional who can not only use AI/ML libraries but understand the math driving them.
