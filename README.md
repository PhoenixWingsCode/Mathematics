📘 Math for AI/ML – College Algebra & Precalculus with Python
Welcome to my open-source math learning journey built with 💡 clarity, code, and curiosity.

This repo is a part of a structured series that blends mathematical intuition with hands-on coding using Python & Jupyter Notebooks — tailored for learners entering fields like AI, ML, Data Science, Game Dev, or Software Engineering.

📚 What’s Inside
✅ College Algebra (Beginner–Intermediate)
A complete foundation in algebra, visualized and coded. Concepts are not only taught—they're applied.

Notebook Title	What You’ll Learn
Demand and Revenue	Real-life linear models for business & economics
Exponents and Logarithms	Laws, simplifications, and exponential applications
Factoring	GCF, trinomials, difference of squares
Fractions and Decimals	Simplifying and operating on rational numbers
Functions	Domain, range, evaluation, and types of functions
Graphing	Coordinate plane, intercepts, and behavior
Parent Graphs	Visualizing and identifying common graph shapes
Proportions	Solving with ratios and real-world cases
Quadratics	Forms, solving methods, and graphing
Simple & Compound Interest	Finance-focused exponential growth/decay
Slope (Sloping)	Rise/run, parallelism, and graph interpretation
Solving Systems	Graphical, substitution & elimination methods
Word Problems	Applying algebra to practical scenarios

🧮 Precalculus (In Progress, Intermediate–Advanced)
A rich blend of math + code + visual exploration.

Notebook Title	Skill Highlights
Unit Circle, Trig Graphs, Law of Sines/Cosines	Master trigonometry
Complex Numbers	Real + Imaginary math
Matrices & Inverse	Solving systems and transformations
Pascal’s Triangle & Series	Combinatorics and patterns
Graphing the Mandelbrot Set	Algebra meets fractals
Probability & Gambling Math	Fun, practical statistics
Encoding & Decoding Messages	Math in cryptography
Building a Clock with Trig	Creative applications

📓 Jupyter Notebooks

📈 Matplotlib, Plotly (for visualizations)

🧮 SymPy, NumPy

🚀 Why This?
While pursuing my MCA in AI/ML, I realized most learners struggle with the math behind the models. So, I created this series to help:

Solidify math intuition

Connect math ↔ code

Enable hands-on practice before diving into AI/ML algorithms

This is just the beginning.
