📘 College Algebra – Interactive Jupyter Notebooks
Welcome to the College Algebra repository — a collection of well-structured, beginner-to-intermediate level Jupyter Notebooks covering essential algebraic topics in an interactive and practical way. This is part of a larger mathematics learning series which includes Precalculus, Calculus, Statistics, and Linear Algebra.

This repository is ideal for:

🎓 Students revisiting or learning algebra fundamentals

💡 Self-learners preparing for AI/ML or Data Science foundations

🧠 Anyone wanting to strengthen their math reasoning and intuition

📂 Topics Covered
Each notebook focuses on conceptual understanding, visualizations, and hands-on examples using Python (where helpful). Here's what you’ll find:
