📘 Math for AI/ML – Algebra, Precalculus & Calculus with Python
Welcome to my open-source math repo — built at the intersection of clarity, code, and curiosity.

As someone deeply passionate about AI/ML, I believe mathematical thinking is the real power behind intelligent systems. That’s why I’m rebuilding the core — from College Algebra to Calculus — using Python + Jupyter Notebooks to connect abstract theory with real code.

📚 What’s Inside
✅ College Algebra
Solid algebraic grounding is the backbone of applied mathematics. I’ve translated this foundation into interactive notebooks with math problems coded, visualized, and explored.

📓 Notebook Title	💡 Key Concepts
Functions, Slope, Quadratics	Domain, range, intercepts, forms
Exponents, Logarithms	Rules, applications, base changes
Graphing & Parent Graphs	Coordinate geometry, shape intuition
Fractions, Factoring, Proportions	Algebraic manipulation and logic
Demand, Revenue & Interest	Real-world linear & exponential models
Solving Systems & Word Problems	Multiple solving strategies

🧮 Precalculus (Intermediate–Advanced)
This section dives into trigonometry, probability, complex numbers, and matrices — with math rendered beautifully in code.

📓 Notebook Title	💡 Skill Highlights
Unit Circle & Trig Graphs	Core trig concepts + visualizations
Law of Sines & Cosines	Triangle solving techniques
Pascal’s Triangle & Series	Combinatorics & patterns
Mandelbrot Set	Fractals meet algebra
Probability & Gambling Math	Fun + practical applications
Clock with Trig	Creativity with coordinates

📐 College Calculus (New)
This is where things get real — derivatives, limits, Riemann sums, areas under curves, and physical applications like projectile motion, center of mass, and volumes of revolution.

📓 Notebook Title	💡 Core Topics
Derivatives, Chain Rule, Implicit Diff	Foundational differentiation
Related Rates, Mean Value Theorem	Applied motion & analysis
Limits, Tangents, Product/Quotient Rule	Fundamental calculus logic
Area Between Curves, Surface Area	Definite integrals in action
Center of Mass, Volumes (X/Y-axis)	Physical interpretations
Riemann Sums, Fundamental Theorem	From discrete to continuous

🧭 Why I Built This
As an MCA student specializing in AI/ML, I realized math isn't a barrier—it's a bridge. This repo reflects my structured journey to:

🔍 Build deep mathematical intuition

🔄 Map math ↔ code in real-time

🧪 Prepare for advanced AI/ML models with confidence

This isn’t a tutorial. It’s my evolving skillset, shared openly.
